# Python-Playground
Just some side projects that i've created on the side using python.

contact.py is a python script that is used to store contact information into an sqlite database. It does everything from adding, deleting, showing all contacts. Needs
nees improvement on the basic UI and selecting one specific instance of a contact rather than just showing them all.
